# Project Documentation

Welcome to the AI Actions Demos documentation!

## Overview

This project demonstrates four powerful ways to integrate AI models into GitHub Actions workflows for intelligent automation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-actions-demos.git
cd ai-actions-demos
```

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with Actions enabled
- GitHub Copilot subscription (for GitHub Models API access)
- Repository permissions configured for automation

## Demos

### 1. AI-Driven Issue Triage

Automatically validates new issues for completeness and requests missing information.

**How it works:**
- Triggers when issues are opened
- AI analyzes issue content
- Posts helpful comments if more information is needed

### 2. Automatic Release Notes

Generate professional release notes from merged pull requests.

**How it works:**
- Manually triggered with date range
- Fetches and categorizes PRs
- Creates formatted GitHub Release

### 3. Weekly Issue Summary

Scheduled weekly digest of open issues with AI-powered prioritization.

**How it works:**
- Runs every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- Analyzes all open issues
- Creates summary issue with insights

### 4. Documentation Auto-Updater (Project Bloom)

Keeps documentation synchronized with code changes automatically.

**How it works:**
- Triggers on code changes in `src/`
- AI analyzes diffs and updates docs
- Commits changes automatically

## Configuration

### Workflow Permissions

Ensure your repository has the correct permissions:
1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Set Workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions"
3. Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### GitHub Models API

All demos use GitHub Models API (gpt-4o-mini) which requires:
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- No additional API keys needed
- Authentication via `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic)

## Customization

### Adjusting AI Prompts

**Demos 1-2 (Inline prompts):**
Edit the workflow YAML files directly and modify the prompt in the API call.

**Demos 3-4 (External prompts):**
Edit the prompt files in `.github/prompts/` directory:
- `weekly-summary-prompt.txt` - For issue summary logic
- `docs-update-prompt.txt` - For documentation update style

### Changing Triggers

Modify the `on:` section in workflow files to change when they run.

Example - run issue triage on labeled issues too:
```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Resource not accessible by integration"**
- Fix: Enable write permissions in repository settings

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Fix: Reduce workflow frequency or upgrade Copilot tier

**Workflow doesn't trigger**
- Fix: Verify trigger conditions and file paths match your setup

### Debugging

View workflow logs:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on workflow run
3. Expand steps to see detailed output

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation platform
- **GitHub Models API**: LLM inference (gpt-4o-mini)
- **GitHub CLI**: Repository operations
- **Bash/Shell**: Scripting and orchestration

### Security

- Uses `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication
- No external API keys required
- Minimal permission scopes
- Automated commits use bot account

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** - Test one workflow before deploying all
2. **Monitor usage** - Track API calls and workflow runs
3. **Iterate prompts** - Refine based on results
4. **Keep humans in loop** - AI assists, humans decide
5. **Document changes** - Track prompt modifications in git

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check this documentation
2. Review workflow logs in Actions tab
3. Open an issue with the `question` label
4. Refer to [GitHub Actions docs](https://docs.github.com/actions)
