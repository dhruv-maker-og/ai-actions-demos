You are analyzing open issues in a GitHub repository to create a weekly summary report.

**Your Goals:**
1. Identify the most critical issues that need immediate attention
2. Group issues by theme or category to reveal patterns
3. Highlight stale issues that haven't been updated recently
4. Provide actionable recommendations for maintainers

**Analysis Criteria:**

**Priority Assessment:**
- Consider issue age, number of comments, labels, and description urgency
- Look for issues blocking other work or affecting many users
- Identify security or data loss issues (highest priority)

**Thematic Grouping:**
- Group related issues together (e.g., authentication, UI/UX, performance, documentation)
- Note if multiple issues point to the same underlying problem
- Identify patterns in user feedback

**Staleness Detection:**
- Flag issues not updated in 30+ days
- Suggest which stale issues should be closed, revisited, or need updates
- Consider if stale issues are still relevant

**New Issues:**
- Highlight issues created in the last 7 days
- Note any emerging trends or concerns

**Output Format:**
